# PSDeploy Docs

PSDeploy uses ReadTheDocs to host our documentation.
This allows us to keep our docs in the repository, without the various limitations that come with the built in GitHub repo wiki.

Contributions welcome:

* Clone the PSDeploy
* Checkout the [dev branch](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDeploy/tree/dev)
* Commit changes
  * Organization is described in the [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDeploy/blob/dev/mkdocs.yml) file
  * mkdocs.yml points to markdown files in [the docs folder](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDeploy/tree/dev/docs)
  * Images are stored and accessible from docs/images
* Submit a pull request to the dev branch
