PSDeploy uses ReadTheDocs to host our documentation.  This allows us to keep our docs in the repository, without the various limitations that come with the built in GitHub repo wiki.

  * Images are stored and accessible from [docs/images](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDeploy/tree/master/docs/images)
