AppVeyor allows you to publish NuGet packages which you can access via PowerShellGet and commands like `Install-Module`.  The AppVeyorModule deployment type simplifies publishing to this NuGet feed.

This idea was borrowed from the PowerShell team's use of AppVeyor to distribute [development builds](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources#development-builds) for DSC resources.

# Simple Example

This example illustrates using the AppVeyorModule deployment to publish a module directly to AppVeyor, as a zip file and a NuGet package.

Here's the deployment config, My.PSDeploy.ps1:

```PowerShell
Deploy DeveloperBuild {
    By AppVeyorModule {
        FromSource MyModuleNameHere
        To AppVeyor
    }
}
```

This assumes your repo contains a folder in it for your module, `MyModuleNameHere`

## Real Example

Here's a quick example from PSDeploy itself, and some notes on accessing the package.

```PowerShell
# Publish to AppVeyor if we're in AppVeyor
if(
    $env:BHProjectName -and $ENV:BHProjectName.Count -eq 1 -and
    $env:BHBuildSystem -eq 'AppVeyor'
   )
{
    Deploy DeveloperBuild {
        By AppVeyorModule {
            FromSource $ENV:BHProjectName
            To AppVeyor
            WithOptions @{
                Version = $env:APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The $ENV:BH* variables are created via [BuildHelpers](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/BuildHelpers).

Here are the resulting artifacts as seen on AppVeyor:

Note that by default, your project's NuGet feed may have some random characters to add uniqueness.  To view or configure this URL in AppVeyor, browse to your project settings, NuGet tab:

[![Source](images/appveyornuget.png)](images/appveyornuget.png)

Now that I know the URL, I'm ready to register and use this feed:

```PowerShell
Register-PSRepository -Name PSDeploy -SourceLocation https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/psdeploy

Find-Module -Repository PSDeploy

# Version Name     Type   Repository Description
# ------- ----     ----   ---------- -----------
# 1.0.146 psdeploy Module PSDeploy   psdeploy
```
